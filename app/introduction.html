            <p>Hi, my name is Danny.</p>
            <p>I'm a software engineer, currently studied in Saigon University.</p>
            <p>After many attempt making my own landing page, but failed todo so because is either unmotivated, burnout
                halfway or feel like a mess doing project and got me to abandoned my past project, although i'm still
                determined to sit down and create another.</p>
            <p>Starting this project is a tough one for me, i find that is hard to start a new page with a blank project
                is really exhausting, the reason that i keep going is that the journey of learning along the way and i
                had learning alot over few weeks.</p>
            <p>Hope you like what i'm showing! and if you are then head over to my project repo and give it a star! so
                it motivate me to keep going ^^.</p>
            <p><i><strong>P/S:</strong> The repo of this project is public so if anyone want to learn, feel free to
                check it out!</i></p>
